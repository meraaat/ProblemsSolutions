# Greedy Problems

# Greedy vs Dynamic Programming

| Feature | Greedy | Dynamic Programming |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Strategy** | Choose **locally optimal** solution to get global optimum | Breaks problem into **subproblems** & solve to solve |
| **Approach** | ‚ùå **Never** reconsiders its choices | **All possible solutions** are considered |
| **Table** | **No table** used to store | Uses a **table to store** solutions to subproblems |
| **Time Complexity** | **More efficient**, simple & easy to implement | **Slower** |
